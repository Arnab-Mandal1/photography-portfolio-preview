Version: 1.0
Date: September 11, 2025
Author: Gemini

1. Introduction & Vision 🌟
   This document outlines the requirements for a single-page photography portfolio website. The project is a modern,
   minimalist, and visually-driven web application built with React.

The vision is to create a sleek and professional digital storefront that showcases the photographer's talent, captivates
potential clients, and provides a clear, frictionless path to making an inquiry. The emphasis is on simplicity,
performance, and aesthetic elegance.

2. Project Goals & Objectives 🎯
   Primary Goal: To serve as a primary marketing tool to attract and convert potential clients into business leads.

Key Objectives:

Showcase Work: Display a curated selection of high-quality photographs in an engaging and beautiful layout.

Facilitate Contact: Make it incredibly simple for visitors to get in touch via a contact form or direct links.

Build Brand: Establish a professional and memorable online presence that reflects the photographer's unique style.

Ensure Accessibility: Deliver a fast, responsive, and seamless experience on any device (desktop, tablet, or mobile).

3. Target Audience 👥
   Potential Clients: Individuals, families, couples, and businesses looking to hire a photographer for events,
   portraits, commercial work, etc.

Industry Professionals: Art directors, creative agencies, editors, and collaborators looking for talent.

General Visitors: Admirers of photography and network contacts.

4. Features & Requirements 📝
   The application will be a single page with distinct sections.

User Stories & Features:
Navigation Bar

As a user, I want to easily navigate to different sections of the page so I can find information quickly.

Requirements:

A sticky header that remains visible on scroll.

Photographer's logo or name on the left.

Smooth-scrolling anchor links to "Gallery" and "Contact" sections.

Hero Section

As a user, I want to be immediately impressed by a stunning visual that represents the photographer's best work.

Requirements:

A full-screen, high-impact photograph.

Minimal text overlay: the photographer's name and a short, compelling tagline (e.g., "Capturing Moments, Creating
Memories").

Photo Gallery

As a user, I want to browse a collection of photos in an intuitive and visually pleasing way.

Requirements:

Display a curated grid of 15-25 select photos.

A responsive masonry or grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Images must be optimized for the web (e.g., compressed, served in WebP format) for fast loading.

A subtle hover effect on each photo (e.g., slight zoom or a transparent overlay).

Lightbox Functionality: Clicking an image opens it in a full-screen modal view with:

Ability to navigate to the next/previous image.

A clear "Close" button (X icon).

The ability to close the lightbox by pressing the Esc key.

Contact Section

As a potential client, I want a simple and direct way to contact the photographer to ask about their services.

Requirements:

A clear call-to-action heading (e.g., "Let's Work Together").

A simple contact form with fields for Name, Email, and Message.

Basic client-side form validation (e.g., check for valid email format).

A direct mailto: email link for users who prefer their own email client.

Icon links to professional social media profiles (e.g., Instagram, Behance).

Footer

As a user, I expect to find copyright information at the bottom of the page.

Requirements:

A simple footer containing a copyright notice: © [Current Year] [Photographer Name]. All Rights Reserved.

5. Non-Functional Requirements ⚙️
   Performance: 🚀 The site must load quickly. Target a Google PageSpeed Insights score of 90+ for both mobile and
   desktop. Implement lazy loading for gallery images.

Responsiveness: 📱 The design must be mobile-first and fully functional and beautiful on all screen sizes, from small
phones to large desktop monitors.

Accessibility (a11y): ♿ The site should be usable by everyone. This includes providing descriptive alt text for all
images, ensuring keyboard navigability, and maintaining sufficient color contrast.

Browser Compatibility: 🌐 The site must function correctly on the latest two versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox,
Safari, Edge).

Technology Stack: 🛠️

Frontend Framework: React (using Vite or Create React App).

Styling: A modern CSS solution like Tailwind CSS or Styled-Components.

Deployment: A static hosting service like Vercel or Netlify for continuous deployment.

6. Future Scope (Version 2.0) 🔮
   While not part of the initial release, the following features may be considered for future updates:

CMS Integration: Connect to a headless CMS (like Contentful or Sanity) so the photographer can update photos and text
without needing a developer.

Multiple Galleries: Add functionality to create and display separate galleries for different categories (e.g., "
Portraits," "Weddings," "Landscapes").

Blog/Journal: A section for the photographer to share stories, behind-the-scenes content, or tips.

Testimonials Section: A dedicated area to display quotes from happy clients.

Sitemap & Component Structure
Sitemap 🗺️
Since this is a single-page application, the sitemap is straightforward. It consists of a single root page with anchor
links pointing to the different sections within that page.

/ (Homepage)

/#gallery - The view scrolls to the Photo Gallery section.

/#contact - The view scrolls to the Contact section.

React Component Structure 🧱
This is a suggested component hierarchy based on the principle of breaking down the UI into logical, reusable pieces.

src/
├── App.js (The main component that assembles all the page sections)
│
├── assets/
│ ├── images/ (Contains gallery photos, logo, hero image, etc.)
│ └── icons/ (SVG icons for social media, close button, etc.)
│
└── components/
│
├── Header.js
│ └── Renders the sticky navigation bar with the photographer's name/logo and the smooth-scrolling links ("Gallery", "
Contact").
│
├── Hero.js
│ └── Renders the full-screen landing view with the main photograph and tagline.
│
├── Gallery.js
│ └── This is the parent component for the photo showcase. It will:
│ - Fetch and manage the list of photos.
│ - Map over the photo data to render <ImageCard /> components.
│ - Manage the state for the <Lightbox /> (e.g., which image is currently open).
│
├── ImageCard.js
│ └── A reusable component representing a single photo thumbnail in the gallery grid. It handles its own hover effects
and has an onClick handler to open the lightbox.
│
├── Lightbox.js
│ └── The modal component that displays a single, full-sized image. It receives props to display the correct image and
includes its own UI for "next," "previous," and "close" actions.
│
├── Contact.js
│ └── The parent component for the contact section. It contains the introductory text and the contact form.
│
├── ContactForm.js
│ └── A dedicated component for the form itself. It will:
│ - Manage the state for the name, email, and message input fields.
│ - Handle form validation and the submission logic.
│
└── Footer.js
└── Renders the simple footer with the copyright text and potentially social media links.
